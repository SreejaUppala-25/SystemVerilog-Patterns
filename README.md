# SystemVerilog-Patterns
This repository contains SystemVerilog code demonstrating the use of constraints to generate specific patterns in testbench simulations. The code is implemented in a simple and easy-to-understand way, making it ideal for learning and practicing constraint-based randomization in SystemVerilog.
